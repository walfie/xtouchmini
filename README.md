# xtouchmini

Collection of utilities for interacting with the [Behringer X-Touch Mini] MIDI
controller, including reading button/knob/fader inputs and sending outputs to
change lighting.

There's also a bunch of random stuff in the repo specific to my own use-cases
(interacting with VTubeStudio's proprietary API, OBS, emulating keyboard
events, etc).
